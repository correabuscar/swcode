user_pref("intl.accept_languages",				"en-US, en");//orig (the ' ' aka space is optional) and capitalization doesn't matter because in code they're lowercased, however the Accept-Language header always becomes 'en-US,en' with that case-sensitivity, regardless of the case-sensitivity value of this pref! XXX Keeping "en-US,en" because it's used raw as header in services/common/hawkrequest.js (dno what that is tho), XXX it's set to "en-US, en" when privacy.spoof_english=2 as seen in toolkit/components/resistfingerprinting/RFPHelper.jsm
